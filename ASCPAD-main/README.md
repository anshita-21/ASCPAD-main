# ASCPAD - Automated System for Challan Payment and Accident Detection

ASCPAD was developed with the aim of providing convenient support to vehicle owners, traffic police officers, and the Regional Transport Office (RTO).

The first module of ASCPAD is dedicated to vehicle towing services. Whenever a vehicle is parked in a no-parking zone on roads, traffic police officers can use this module to enter the details of vehicle. The vehicle is then taken to the nearest police station, and the vehicle owner receives a challan, which they are required to pay. This process aims to streamline the towing and challan issuance process, reducing corruption and ensuring a more efficient handling of such situations.

The second module of ASCPAD is focused on challan generation for violations of traffic rules while driving vehicles. Traffic police officers can issue challans online for the respective traffic rule violations committed by the vehicle drivers. This digital approach helps in maintaining accurate records and improves the overall efficiency of the law enforcement process.

The third module of ASCPAD serves as a user interface for vehicle owners. Through this interface, vehicle owners can access information about their pending challans and make online payments for the challan amounts. Additionally, the platform provides access to the vehicle owner's previous challan history, allowing them to keep track of their compliance with traffic rules and any outstanding payments.

Overall, ASCPAD aims to create a more streamlined, transparent, and user-friendly system for dealing with traffic-related issues, benefiting vehicle owners, traffic police officers, and the RTO.
